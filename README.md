# obsidian-finance-tracker

I have created a finance tracker that will allow you track your expenditure in Obsidian.
This Financial tracker helps you visualize how much you have spent in a day/ month/ all time.

The plugiin looks for a specific regex as follows:
  <Date in dd-mm-yyyy> | <Category> | <Item> | <Amount>
The pattern will be looked throughout the obsidian vault and adds it into the data

Currently the supported categories are:
  i) Food
  ii) Traveling
  iii) Subscriptions
  iv) Shopping
  v) Rent/Bills
  vi) Personal Care
  vii) Entertainment
  viii) Miscellaneous
Any category not in the first 7, will automatically be considered as Miscellaneous. 

Contributions and ideas for new features are welcomed.
