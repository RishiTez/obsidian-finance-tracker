# obsidian-finance-tracker

I have created a finance tracker that will allow you track your expenditure in Obsidian.
This Financial tracker helps you visualize how much you have spent in a day/ month/ all time.

The plugiin looks for a specific regex as follows:  
Date in dd-mm-yyyy | Category | Item | Amount  
The pattern will be looked throughout the obsidian vault and adds it into the data

Currently the supported categories are:  
  1) Food
  2) Traveling
  3) Subscriptions
  4) Shopping
  5) Rent/Bills
  6) Personal Care
  7) Entertainment
  8) Miscellaneous
     
Any category not in the first 7, will automatically be considered as Miscellaneous. 

Contributions and ideas for new features are welcomed.
